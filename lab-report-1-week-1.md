## 2. Remotely connecting

Now, you want to get your course specific account/User ID to log in to UCSD's server at:     
https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php             
Reset the password and then type in ==ssh cs15lfa22zz@&#65279;ieng6.ucsd.edu== where zz
is your unique id. It will ask you to type in your password you just reset.
